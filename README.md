# dashcrawler
dashcrawler crawls (spiders) the dash network a reports on the nodes it finds and stores them in a sqlite database.  This would be the backend database for what should be displayed with a nice web-front TBD.  Requires a bunch of dependencies it auto detects and asks the user to install, tested on Debian based systems, but should work on rpm based systems too.

./dashcrawler.sh -h
